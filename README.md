# college-complaint-management-system

The objective of this project is to develop a web application to collaborate among the riders. Once registered, the member can login to the site and access the forum area. They can host their own rides or join the available ones. Details about the rides are sent to the admin by the host which if accepted will be published in the website. If a rider wants to join the ride, he must request it to the host who may accept or decline based on the review of the user. If accepted, a booking confirmation mail will be sent to the member. Reviews for the ride will be given by the users. On the basis of review , admin can allow the user to continue the future rides.
